Customer Churn Prediction Project

Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a telecom company using a real-world dataset of 7,000+ customers.

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical features for machine learning compatibility.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key churn drivers, such as contract type, monthly charges, internet service type, and customer support services.

Applied feature engineering and scaling to numerical columns to improve model performance.

Built and evaluated multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, KNN, SVM, and a Voting Classifier ensemble, using 10-fold cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.

Achieved a best ROC-AUC score of 84.8% with the Voting Classifier, identifying high-risk customers for proactive retention strategies.

Visualized insights using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, highlighting patterns in customer behavior that contribute to churn.

This solution helps businesses reduce customer churn, optimize marketing campaigns, and increase revenue by targeting at-risk customers.
